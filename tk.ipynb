    "\n",
    "A Graphical user interface (GUI) is a desktop application that allows users to interact with computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphical representations such as buttons and icons are included, and communication can be accomplished by interconnecting with the icons.\n",

    "- Tkinter is Python's standard GUI library\n",

    "When establishing a Python application with GUI, there are two primary approaches that the user\n",

    "has to follow after importing tkinter module:\n",
    "- Tk() - It is used to make a main window.\n",
    "- mainloop() - It is an infinite loop that runs the application, waits for an event, and processes it as soon as the window is open.\n",
