## Creation of conda env

- conda create -n my_env python=3.9
- conda create -p /path/to/my_env python=3.9

This creates an environment named my_env in the /path/to/my_env directory.

### Key differences:

- -n specifies the environment name.
- -p specifies the path to create the environment.
  Choosing between the two:
- Use -n when you want to create an environment in the default location (usually conda/envs).
- Use -p when you want to specify a custom location for the environment.
  Additional notes:
- You can install additional packages when creating an environment using the -n or -p flag followed by package names.
- You can activate an environment using conda activate <environment_name>.
- You can list all environments using conda env list.
